    <h1>KERSTDORP KOLHORN</h1>
    <p>I maintain and update the website for <a href="https://kerstdorpkolhorn.nl/" class="inline-link">Kerstdorp Kolhorn<i class="fa-solid fa-square-arrow-up-right fa-xs"></i></a> the christmas market/event in my town, the current version was made over a year ago. when I now look at it I see many issues.</p>
    <p>but it was the first website I fully made from scratch and then put online, it taught me a lot about the smaller details in uploading and maintaining a website for a client.</p>
    <p>because its updated yearly ive tried to make it in such a way that updating the sponsors and the files that change yearly like the map are easily changed without reconstructing the website.</p>
    <p>I think if I made the website again now I would make it in the same fashion as my portfolio using php includes to get different pages, at the time I thought that for different pages you had to make a seperate html file and swap between them with linking.</p>
