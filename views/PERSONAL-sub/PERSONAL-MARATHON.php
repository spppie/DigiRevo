    <h1>MARATHON</h1>
    <p>My Marathon inspired project was made after the trailers for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvbEnWLRo1s" class="inline-link">cinematic short<i class="fa-solid fa-square-arrow-up-right fa-xs"></i></a> was released</p>
    <p>The inspiration was mostly aethestic and for some of the text used in the console.</p>
    <p>For this project I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS. within the JS i used a lot of DOM manipulation, the CSS is relatively simple and because of the inspiration was relatively important. See the project in the links below</p>
    <p>more recently it has come out that a lot of the artstyle was stolen / copied from an artist that got no credit nor gave permission.</p>
